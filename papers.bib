 abstract = {Suppose that one of n people knows a rumor. At the first stage, he passes the rumor to someone chosen at random; at each stage, each person already informed ("knower") communicates the rumor to a person chosen at random and independently of all other past and present choices. Denote by S<sub>n</sub> the random number of stages before everybody is informed. How large is S<sub>n</sub> typically? Frieze and Grimmet, who introduced this problem, proved that, in probability, S<sub>n</sub>/(log<sub>2</sub> n + log n) → 1. In this paper we show that, in fact, S<sub>n</sub> = log<sub>2</sub> n + log n + O(1) in probability. Our proof demonstrates that the number I(t) of persons informed after t stages obeys very closely, with high probability, a deterministic equation I(t + 1) = n - (n - I(t)) exp (- I(t)/n), t ≥ 0. A case when each knower passes the rumor to several members at every stage is also discussed.},
